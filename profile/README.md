Welcome to DarkArmy where high-school students gather to *create*, _innovate_   and _share_. Come and Join us.


### ðŸŒˆ Get Involved

We'd love to have you involved in HerInTech

## âœ¨ Our Philosophy

We think learning to code is uniquely like gaining a superpower: it converts you from a _consumer_ to a _creator_, turning your computer into a tool for creation. If youâ€™re reading this, you can learn to build an appâ€”thereâ€™s never been a better time for making.

**The goal of DarkArmy is to help you develop your superpowers.**Â We want an inclusive space on the internet for teenagers.
